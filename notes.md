# Practice Project: Build a form

## Form contents
- Email
- Country
- Zip Code
- Password
- Password Confirmation

## Requirements
- use live inline validation (highlighting and providing a useful error message)
- don't actually submit the form, but do give an error when form has active errors or unfilled required fields
- all of the validation should occur in the JS file
- give the user a high five when the form is valid and submitted/submittable

## Steps laid out
- [x] Set up a blank HTML
- [ ] Think about setup before touching the code
  - [ ] How would you set up the different form elements
  - [ ] What objects and functions will you need
- [ ] Write the simple form elements
- [ ] Add the JS code to check validation during form progress
  - [ ] When user leaves field, validate that field
- [ ] Test all possible cases
= [ ] Style the form using `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes
